Hi! I'm Ajay Kumar, co-founder and Executive Director at [SARA](https://sara-edu.netlify.app/), where we teach data science to under-represented communities in India. I’m passionate to make learning data science engaging and effective (possibly fun). I currently live in Sonipat, HR with my daughter, mom and wife.

Away from work, I love jogging and cooking.
